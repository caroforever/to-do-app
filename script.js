//add a submit event listener on the form

    //stop the page from refreshing when the form is submitted.

    //only if the user has entered an actual task (aka input is not empty): if/else statement

    //grab user's TO DO input from the form
    //display TO DO input to the page within an li element
        //include a checkbox icon within the li
    // add the li element to the ul

// clicking on a task allows you to toggle between unchecked/checked (aka done vs not done).

//BONUS LEVEL:
// add a "reset" button which clears all the To Dos
// add an "edit task" button
// add a "remove task" button to each task
// add a congratulations alert when all of the existing To Dos are checked
// add a "take a break" message if 5 or more tasks are completed
